Mobile First Foundation
=====================

***Update: This repo was created to address the need for Mobile First development using the Foundation framework. Foundation 4 adopts the Mobile First philosophy, so this repository serves as an archive for F2.2.

Foundation is a rock-solid, responsive framework for rapidly prototyping and iterating into production code. It includes a 12-column, future-friendly grid and tons of great tools and elements that'll get you up and running in no time.

Mobile First Foundation is a fork of Foundation 2.2 that brings the Mobile First development approach to the Foundation framework. With Mobile First Foundation, you'll be building your site's styles for smallest devices first, giving lower powered devices less to load. It also includes a handful of other niceties to keep mobile devices first.

Foundation is MIT-licensed and absolutely free to use. Mobile First Foundation is maintained by Adam Fairhead of Fairhead Creative.
