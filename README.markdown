Mobile First Foundation
=====================

Foundation is a rock-solid, responsive framework for rapidly prototyping and iterating into production code. It includes a 12-column, future-friendly grid and tons of great tools and elements that'll get you up and running in no time.

Mobile First Foundation is a fork that brings the Mobile First development approach to the Foundation framework. With Mobile First Foundation, you'll be building your site's styles for the smallest devices first.

Foundation is MIT-licensed and absolutely free to use. Mobile First Foundation is maintained by Adam Fairhead of Fairhead Creative. Foundation wouldn't be possible without the support of the entire ZURB team and some luminaries who did some heavy lifting that we took advantage of (thanks guys).
