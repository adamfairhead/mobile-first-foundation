Mobile First Foundation
=====================

Foundation is a rock-solid, responsive framework for rapidly prototyping and iterating into production code. It includes a 12-column, future-friendly grid and tons of great tools and elements that'll get you up and running in no time.

Mobile First Foundation is a fork that brings the Mobile First development approach to the Foundation framework. With Mobile First Foundation, you'll be building your site's styles for smallest devices first, giving lower powered devices less to load. It also includes a handful of other niceties to keep mobile devices first.

Mobile First Foundation is currently based on Foundation 2.2. I'll try to keep it inline with the latest version as best as I can.

Foundation is MIT-licensed and absolutely free to use. Mobile First Foundation is maintained by Adam Fairhead of Fairhead Creative.
