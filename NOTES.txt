Mobile First
************

Pages load the mobile css on small screens. Desktop code only loads when the browser reaches 767px.
Due to this, Javascript must be enabled on the client's device to see desktop layouts.

The tradeoff is essentially faster load times for mobiles at expense of no-js users.


Responsive Images
*****************

To use Responsive Images, use the following format:

<img src="path/small.jpg?full=path/large.jpg" alt="Image"/>

The small image will load on screens up to 480px. The large one will load on screens 480px+.
