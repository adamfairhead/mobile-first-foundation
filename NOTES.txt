Mobile First
************

Pages load the mobile css on small screens. Desktop code only loads when the browser reaches 767px.
Because of this, Javascript must be enabled on the client's device to see desktop layouts.

The tradeoff is essentially faster loading times for low-powered devices at the expense of no-js users.

On the flip side, old desktop browsers like IE6 no longer totally bork your designs; they instead load the mobile design: with a few tweaks, you can provide a basic - yet functional - design to users with really old browsers.
